# Intune
This section contains scripts and elements for bringing the deviceTRUST installation and config files to your Intune managed devices. It has been developed based on Nickolaj Andersens (@NickolajA) great "IntuneWin32App" PowerShell Module: https://github.com/MSEndpointMgr/IntuneWin32App. Using the module is a requirement for our config to be applied.
